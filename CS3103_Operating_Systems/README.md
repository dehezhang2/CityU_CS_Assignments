# CS3103: Operating System

This course introduced operating system topics. According to the course description, this course aims to introduce the concepts, roles and functionality of operating systems, which are an essential part of any computer system.  By going through the major areas in the development of operating systems including process management, memory management, scheduling, I/O and disk management, students are expected to gain a broad understanding of key approaches to operating system design and implementation. By discussing the design issues of different approaches, students should be able to analyse the trade-offs and contrast their performance in satisfying different system and application requirements.
