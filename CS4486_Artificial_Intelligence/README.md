# CS4486: Artificial Intelligence

This course aims to equip students with the skills of problem solving using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through a demonstrable knowledge in a range problem solving methods and the associated knowledge representation and machine learning techniques.

In this project, I combined two technology to train a multi-layer perceptron to do classification on the given diabetes dataset and use it to help predicting unseen data. People usually train ANN with gradient-descent-based backpropagation, however, we will use genetic algorithms to train an ANN and observe its classification performance. More details can be found in the [report](./Report.pdf)
