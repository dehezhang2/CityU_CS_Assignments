# CS4487: Machine Learning

This course introduced machine learning algorithms. According to the course website, the goal of this course is to introduce students to the field of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms allow computers to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns from empirical data, such as text and web documents, images, videos, sound, sensor-data, and databases. This course is intended to give a broad overview of machine learning from the practical standpoint, with a focus on applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. At the end of the course, students will have both working knowledge of and practical experience with machine learning algorithms.

## Description

This repository contains the assignment and the project of the course. The project is about a image classification competition, more details can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs4487cp/overview). In this project, I worked with [Wenbo Yang](https://github.com/yangwenbo99) and achieved Rank 6/39 in the final competition. We also provide the [report](./Report_of_CS4487_Project.pdf) in this repository.
