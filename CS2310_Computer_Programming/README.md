# CS2310: Computer Programming

This course introduced fundamental programming skills using the language C++. According to the course description, this course aims to equip students with essential programming skills for object-oriented (OO) programming using C++, so as to lay a solid foundation for other computer science related courses. 

Since it has been a long duration before I set up this repository, I miss part of the assignment description files.
