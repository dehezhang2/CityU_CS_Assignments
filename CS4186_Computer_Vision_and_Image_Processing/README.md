# CS4186: Computer Vision and Image Processing

This course introduced basic image processing methods (convolution, SIFT) and computer vision algorithms (3D vision, deep learning). According to the course website, the elective course introduces a thorough grounding of the principles of computer vision and image processing, and seeks to develop studentsâ€™ knowledge from basic image processing techniques to advanced computer vision and image analysis systems. It concentrates on the fundamental theory of computer vision and image processing with emphasis on the areas of image compression, image segmentation, object recognition, motion analysis and scene understanding.

This repository includes two assignments of this course:

* Assignment 1: Image query method
* Assignment 2: Disparity map computation for stereo
